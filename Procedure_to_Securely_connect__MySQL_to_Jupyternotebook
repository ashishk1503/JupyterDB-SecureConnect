The exploratory data analysis was done by using pandas and the data was referred from Kaggle and also 
with EDA the new concept was implemented which is establishing a secure connection between MySQL and 
Jupyter_Notebook by using the following Syntax which is as mentioned for establishing connection:

import mysql.connector as sql

mydb = sq.connect(
	host = "Localhost",
	user = "root",
	password = "",
	database = "",
	use_pure = True
)
print(mydb)

Password: The Parameter is dependent on your choice it can be any keyword that you want to specify
however, in my case it is "SQL123"

Database: The parameter is the schema which is saved in MySQL workbench in my case it is balanced_tree
named schema which contained 4 tables which are product_details, product_hierarchy, product_prices,
sales.

Also after this syntax you will establish a connection with a message of confirmation of connection 
which is as follows:

After that usage of mycursor = mydb.cursor()
is necessary after for execution which allows Python code to execute MySQL command in a database session.


For execution of Queries the following syntax is helpful which is as follows:

mycursor.execute( SQL_query )
myresult = my_cursor.fetchall()
for row in myresult:
	print(row)

SQL_query must be in quoted format and also in general for SQL the query must end with a semi-colon which is ";"
but in this case it is not required to end the query with a semi-colon. 
For eg: SQL_query: "select * from table_name"

This is a simple way to connect MySQL server to Jupyter_notebook and use SQL queries in python.
