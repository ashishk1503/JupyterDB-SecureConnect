# JupyterDB-SecureConnect

Problem Statement: Secure Connection Between MySQL and Jupyter Notebook
In the context of data analysis and research, Jupyter Notebooks are widely used for their interactive capabilities and ease of use. However, when working with databases such as MySQL, ensuring the security of data in transit is paramount. Currently, many users face challenges in establishing secure connections between their Jupyter Notebooks and MySQL databases.

Objective:
To develop a standardized approach for establishing a secure connection between MySQL and Jupyter Notebook.

Outcome:
By addressing these issues, we aim to enhance the security posture of data interactions in Jupyter Notebooks while ensuring ease of use and maintaining high performance. This will enable researchers and data analysts to work with sensitive data confidently and responsibly.
